HOWTO virtualenv and pip
========================

1. `virtualenv .` in site directory, decide whether you want site-packages
   via argument (no is default)
2. source bin/activate if your environment allows (also shell func deactivate)
3. Set pip configuration to only work in a virtualenv
4. Create a requirements.txt file via `pip freeze -r requirements.txt >
   requirements.txt` (this method will keep comments and such) or a add packages
   a priori
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install foo.pybundle`
6. `pip bundle foo.pybundle -e requirements.txt`  to create a file for
   distribute


Notes
-----
* Upgrade a package: `pip install --upgrade`
* `pip uninstall` works too
* I don't see a reason to check-in virtualenv directories, however scripting
  env creation and population with a pybundle might be good
* pip supports -e git://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@master#egg=MyProject
